**Project Overview**
- The goal of this project is to create a robust machine learning model capable of predicting housing prices in California. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced regression models, this project highlights the core steps in building an end-to-end data science pipeline.

**Dataset Sources**
- The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains features about California housing. Below are the columns available in the dataset:

- longitude: Longitude of the house location
- latitude: Latitude of the house location
- housing_median_age: Age of the house (in years)
- total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the house
- total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the house
- population: Population of the area around the house
- households: Number of households in the area
- median_income: Median income in the area
- ocean_proximity: Proximity of the house to the ocean (categorical feature)
- median_house_value: Median house value (Target variable)

**Installation**
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install the necessary dependencies

**Usage**
- Open the Notebook
- Open the California_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb file.
- Follow the steps in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Analysis Breakdown**
I have done the exploratory data analysis and the following manipulations on data.

- Creating new features
- Removing outliers
- Transforming skewed features

**Training machine learning algorithms:**
I have trained varimachine learning algorithms like
Linear Regression

**Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: Interactive computing environment for executing and documenting the analysis.
